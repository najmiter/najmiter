# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**My name is Najam** and I am currently a CS student at UOG (***Pakistan***).

## How it all started
Computers have been always intriguing to me ever since I was a child. Changing stuff and ending up ruining the OS on our home computer and then finding ways to fix it before anyone would notice.

I wanted to be computer programmer but at the time, I had no guide or any idea what was possible and where would I even begin. There was DSL internet available at the time. In fact, ours was the only house with internet at that time but I thought internet was only for watching YouTube and exploring Google Earth. Being a child, the only thing I did on the internet was watch cartoons and cat videos.

## First experience
_The first line of code that I ever wrote was in [**BASIC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC)_. And that was in 10th grade.

Just like every person I've ever met in this field, I was also convinced by the concept that whatever the school teaches is all that we learn. Unfortunately, the course outline at the time was not very great at that time. Plus we are only forced to get as much grades as possible and never focus on the actual learning. I was also under the same tyranny.

Even then, I was writing code that wasn't even in the book and that, to me and everyone at the school and my teacher, was something.

### College
The ***first year*** at college was null. The book for computer science had zero code in it. The same old **Floppy Disks** and **Types of printers** was all we got. FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR!

I was still under the spell that if the teacher at the college isn't teaching me, I can't do anything about it.

In the ***second year*** of the college, they finally had [**C**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)). But that only the too basic stuff. BUT, that year, I first started to learn on my own from the internet. It was 2019. I still wouldn't have if it weren't for that video that got recommended to me on YouTube. It was a [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) programming course on freeCodeCamp.

## The year before university
Due to some reasons, I couldn't start the univeristy right after the college which ended in 2020. But during that year, I decided to try **Web Development**. Which meant no Python. I did **HTML and CSS***. Practiced it a lot. Learned quite a lot of concepts. _This was going better than the Python phase_. I even started learning **JavaScript**. I did some DOM manipulation projects ([Windows 11 Clone](https://najmiter.github.io/Windows-11-Clone/), [The Starry Night(CSS Only)](https://najmiter.github.io/The-Peaceful-Night/)).

This was going well. But like most of us, I couldn't remain consistent after about three months. Whatever I had done up until then was learned within those 3 months only. Without anyone watching me over and giving me exercises, I got distracted. Again. It stayed that way until about two weeks before the university in 2021. I did a little bit of **C Programming**.
